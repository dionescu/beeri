beeri
=====

Beeri is a set of libraries and c++ environment that allows you efficient and rapid development
  in c++ 11 on linux systems. More exactly on Ubuntu.
The focus is mostly for backend development, data processing etc.

I will gradually add explanations for most crucial blocks in this library.
For now, in order to build it, you need to install the following prerequisites:

```
sudo apt-get -y install g++ automake libevent-dev cmake libbz2-dev libs3-dev bisonc++ flexc++
sudo apt-get -y install libbz2-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev
```

To build run `./blaze.sh`
